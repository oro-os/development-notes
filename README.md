# Josh Junon's Personal Oro Vault

These are publicized, but personal, notes of mine surrounding the development of Oro.

I just recently (March 2025) found Obsidian again and immediately fell in love with it. I am doing some rather large refactors lately and wanted to document some of my progress, notes, etc.

I figured it'd also be useful to document them here, including ideas I've had.

**Please do not consider any content in this as official Oro planning, correspondence, opinions, or roadmap.** Please also remember that I am not a kernel expert. Take what research I have here with a giant grain of salt. **Please do not cite me nor anything here as authoritative.**

If I have presented an idea here that you like (e.g. ideas for improvements to the Rust ecosystem, compiler, etc. or ideas for modules, etc.) please consider them fair game. If you _do_ end up working on them, or are even just interested, please open an issue to let me know - I'd love to see what you think.

**Please note that I reserve the right to force-push this repository at any time.** Don't rely on linear history here.

## Did I make a mistake?

If I have made a logical error or came to some wrong conclusion somewhere in my notes and you would like to let me know, please open an issue.
